  ## Description
  This application is a backend set up of an api that can be used to create a social media application.  It contains routes to create users and thoughts, as well as, being able to become friends with another user and create reactions to thoughts.  All that someone would need to do to use this application is to create a front-end for the application and call the api routes to the front-end.
